# Coin change

## Statement

Given a set of coin denominations $A$ and a target amount $P$, the goal is to determine the minimum number of coins required to make the exact amount $P$. The answer also states which coins (and how many of each) achieve this minimum.

## Input

- A sorted set of $n$ coin denominations.

    $$
    A = \{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\}, \quad \text{where} \; a_i \in \mathbb{ N } \pand a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n
    $$

- A target amount $P$ (a natural number).

## Output

A tuple $(m_1,m_2,\dots,m_n)$ where:

- Each $m_i$ represents the number of times coin $a_i$ is used.

- The total value of the selected coins must equal $P$:

    $$
    \sum_{ i = 1 }^n m_i a_i = P
    $$

- The total number of coins used is minimized:

    $$
    \sum_{ i = 1 }^n m_i \; \text{is minimal}
    $$
