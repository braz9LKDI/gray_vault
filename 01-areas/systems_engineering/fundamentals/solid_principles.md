# SOLID principles

## Single responsibility

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. Each class should focus on a single task or functionality. If a class does too many things, it becomes difficult to maintain.

## Open/closed

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. Achievable with interfaces or abstract classes.

## Liskov substitution

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. If class B inherits from class A, objects of B can replace objects of A without crashing the application or confusing the user.

## Interface segregation

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, it is better to have several small, specific interfaces than one large, "fat" interface.

## Dependency inversion

Depend upon abstractions, not concretions. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces).
