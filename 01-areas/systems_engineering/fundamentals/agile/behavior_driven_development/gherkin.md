# Gherkin

It is a domain-specific language for writing acceptance criteria. It is used to describe business behavior without going into implementation detail.

## Core structure

Given a certain _scenario_ (context), when an _action_ takes place (event), then this should be the _outcome_.

> The scenarios should be specified in third person.

## Keywords

- Feature: the high-level capability or behavior being described (the "what" wanted from the system).

- Scenario: a specific example that shows one behavior of the feature in a concrete situation, written as steps.

- Scenario outline: a scenario template that runs multiple times with different input data.

- Examples: the table (or set) of input values used to generate each run of a scenario outline.

- Rule: a way to group scenarios under a single business rule or constraint, so the feature stays organized around important rules.

- Background: shared setup steps that apply to all (or most) scenarios in the same feature file, used to avoid repeating the same "given" context.

- Given: describes the initial context of the scenario.

- When: describes the action or event.

- Then: describes the expected outcome.

- And: adds another step of the same kind as the previous one.

- But: adds a step that contrasts with the previous one, usually a negative condition.
