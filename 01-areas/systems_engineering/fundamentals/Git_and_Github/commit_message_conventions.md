It says **what kind of change** it is:

- `feat`: new feature.

- `fix`: bug fix.

- `docs`: documentation only.

- `style`: formatting (no logic change).

- `perf`: performance improvement.

- `test`.

- `build`.

- `chore`: maintenance tasks. It does not add a user-facing feature (so not feat) nor does fix a user-facing bug (so no fix), It is usually internal.
