# Dijkstra

It is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path from a starting vertex (the "source") to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

1. Initialization:
    1. Create a set to keep track of visited vertices and a set to keep track of the previous vertex of each one.

    2. Assign a tentative distance value to every vertex: set it to zero for the initial vertex and to infinity for all other vertices.

    3. Set the initial vertex as the current vertex.

2. Iteration:
    1. For the current vertex, consider all of its unvisited neighbors.

    2. For each neighbor, calculate the distance from the source vertex. If this distance is less than the previously recorded distance, update the distance set and previous vertex set.

    3. Once all neighbors of the current vertex have been considered, mark the current vertex as visited. A visited vertex will not be checked again.

3. Selection: select the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance and set it as the new "current vertex".

4. Termination: repeat the process until all vertices have been visited.

## Path reconstruction

To find the shortest path from the source to a destination vertex, the path can be traced backward from the destination using the stored previous vertex information:

1. Start at the destination vertex.

2. Repeatedly move to the previous vertex stored for the current one.

3. Continue until the source vertex is reached.

## Complexity

$O(V^2)$ using an array and $O((V + E) \log V)$ using a binary heap (priority queue), where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ the number of edges.

## C++ implementation
