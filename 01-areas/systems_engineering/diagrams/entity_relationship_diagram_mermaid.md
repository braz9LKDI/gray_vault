# Entity relationship diagram with Mermaid

## Entity definitions

Each entity is defined by its name, typically in uppercase. It can have attributes listed within `{}` in the format `type name`.

> Data types can be included in the attributes.

## Relationships between entities

Relationships are defined using the following structure:

```text
<first-entity> [<relationship> <second-entity> : <relationship-label>]
```

Relationships can have the following types of cardinality, each written as a left or right marker:

- `|o` or `o|`: zero or one.

- `||`: exactly one.

- `}o` or `o{`: zero or more.

- `}|` or `|{`: one or more.

Solid lines indicate identifying relationships (`|--|`), while dashed lines indicate non-identifying relationships (`|..|`).

## Example

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE_ITEM : contains
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses

    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string customer_number
        string sector
    }

    ORDER {
        int order_number
        string delivery_address
    }

    LINE_ITEM {
        string product_code
        int quantity
        float price_per_unit
    }
```
