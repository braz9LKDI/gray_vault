# `class` vs `struct`

`class` and `struct` define user-defined types with different default semantics. The main practical differences are copy behavior, allocation and common usage patterns.

## Copy semantics

A `class` is a [[01-areas/systems_engineering/programming_languages/c_sharp/value_types_vs_reference_types#Reference types|reference type]]. Assignment copies the reference, so multiple variables can point to the same instance.

```cs
class Counter
{
    public int Value;
}

var a = new Counter { Value = 1 };
var b = a;

b.Value = 5;
Console.WriteLine(a.Value); // 5
```

A `struct` is a [[01-areas/systems_engineering/programming_languages/c_sharp/value_types_vs_reference_types#Value types|value type]]. Assignment copies the data, so each variable gets its own copy.

```cs
struct Counter
{
    public int Value;
}

var a = new Counter { Value = 1 };
var b = a;

b.Value = 5;
Console.WriteLine(a.Value); // 1
```

Passing to methods follows the same rule: structs are copied by default, classes are not. `ref`, `in` and `out` can change that behavior for structs.

```cs
static void Increment(Counter c) { c.Value++; }
static void IncrementRef(ref Counter c) { c.Value++; }
```

## When each is typically used

A `class` is typically used when:

- Identity matters (two references pointing to the same instance is meaningful).

- The type is large or frequently mutated.

- Inheritance or polymorphism is needed.

A `struct` is typically used when:

- The value is small and represents a single value concept (for example, coordinates, money or timestamps).

- The type is immutable or treated as immutable.

- Avoiding allocations is beneficial and copying cost stays low.
