# Solution vs project

A C# "solution" is a container that groups one or more projects so they can be opened, run and managed together. A "project" is the unit that actually produces an output (like an exe or a library) and contains the source code, dependencies and build settings needed to compile.

## Solution (`.sln`)

The `.sln` file is mainly an organizer and entry point for tooling (especially Visual Studio, but also `dotnet` workflows indirectly). It records which projects belong to the solution and how they are arranged (folders, build configurations and some per-project settings).

### Practical implications (solution)

Many projects can be stored inside one solution. The solution allows projects to be built together and sets which one starts when pressing "run" in an IDE.

## Project (`.csproj`)

The `.csproj` file defines a single buildable unit. It declares:

- The SDK and target framework(s).

- Output type (exe vs library), assembly name, root namespace and language version.

- Package references (NuGet dependencies) and project references (references to other projects).

- Build settings (nullable, implicit usings, warnings and analyzers).

- Which files are included, plus special items like embedded resources, content files and generated code settings.

### Practical implications (project)

Build and restore happen at the project level. When `dotnet build` or `dotnet test` is run, projects are what is ultimately built; the solution is just a convenient way to point to multiple projects at once.
