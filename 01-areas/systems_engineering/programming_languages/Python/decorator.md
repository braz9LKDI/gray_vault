# Decorator

Allows programmers to modify the behavior of a function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to **extend the behavior** of the wrapped function, **without permanently modifying it**.

In Python, functions are **first-class objects**, which means that functions can be used or passed as arguments.

---

In Decorators, functions are taken as arguments for another function and then called inside the wrapper function.

```python
@my_decorator
def my_function():
    print("")
```

The code above is equivalent to:

```python
def my_function():
    print("")

my_function_decorator = my_decorator(my_function)
```

When a function that receives arguments is "decorated", these arguments can be specified through `*args` and `**kwargs`.

## Usage examples

1. Calculating the time of execution.

    ```python
    import time
    import math


    def calculate_time(function):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            begin = time.time()
            function(*args, **kwargs)
            end = time.time()

            print("Total time taken in : ", function.__name__, end - begin)

        return inner

    @calculate_time
    def factorial(number):
        time.sleep(2)
        print(math.factorial(number))

    factorial(10)
    ```

2. Chaining decorators.

    ```python
    def decorator_1(function):
        def inner():
            number = function()
            return number * 10
        return inner

    def decorator_2(function):
        def inner():
            number = function()
            return number ** 2
        return inner

    @decorator_1
    @decorator_2
    def number():
        return 5

    print(number()) # 250
    ```
