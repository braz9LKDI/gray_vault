# Common immutability patterns

## `init`-only properties

A common pattern is to combine `init` with types that are not expected to change after construction.

```cs
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; init; } = "";
    public string Email { get; init; } = "";
}

var person = new Person
{
    Name = "name",
    Email = "test@domain.com"
};
```

This is often described as shallow immutability.

## `readonly` fields

A `readonly` field can be assigned in the constructor and then not changed later.

```cs
public class Person(string name)
{
    private readonly string _name = name;


    public string Name => _name;
}
```

This pattern is older and stricter, but sometimes more verbose.

## Exposing read-only views

If internal mutable collections must exist, a read-only interface or wrapper is often exposed.

```cs
public class Team
{
    private readonly List<string> _members = new();


    public IReadOnlyList<string> Members => _members;
}
```

This reduces external mutation, even if the internal collection stays mutable.

## Immutable collection types

```cs
using System.Collections.Immutable;


public class Team
{
    public ImmutableArray<string> Members { get; init; }
        = ImmutableArray<string>.Empty;
}
```

This is closer to true immutability because the collection contents cannot be changed in place.
