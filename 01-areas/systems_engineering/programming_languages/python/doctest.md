# Doctest

[[01-areas/systems_engineering/programming_languages/python/docstring|Docstrings]] are used not only for the description of a class or a function to provide a better understanding of the code and its use but also for testing purposes. This module finds patterns in the docstring that look like interactive shell commands. The input and expected output are included in the docstring, then the doctest module uses this docstring for testing the processed output.

## How to use `doctest`

1. Import `testmod` from `doctest` to test the function.

2. Define the function to test.

3. Provide a suitable docstring containing the desired output on certain inputs.

4. Define the logic.

5. Call `testmod` with the name of the function to test and set `verbose` to `True` as arguments.

    > A similar behavior can be achieved using `-v` in the script execution.
    >
    > If `verbose` is set to `False` (default), output will be shown in case of failure only, not in case of success.

## Limitations of `doctest`

- Limited test coverage: `doctest` relies heavily on docstrings, making it suitable mainly for testing small code snippets or simple functions. It may not cover all aspects of complex functions or classes.

- Readability issues: test cases embedded within docstrings can sometimes clutter the documentation, leading to reduced readability, especially for larger projects with numerous tests.

- Brittleness: `doctest` tests are sensitive to changes in output formatting or minor code modifications, which can cause tests to fail unnecessarily. This brittleness makes maintenance challenging, especially in evolving codebases.

## Usage example

```python
def multiple_test_cases(number):
    """
    This function checks multiple test cases for a given number.
    Define input and expected output:
    >>> multiple_test_cases(0)
    'zero'
    >>> multiple_test_cases(5)
    'positive'
    >>> multiple_test_cases(-5)
    'negative'
    >>> multiple_test_cases(100)
    'large positive'
    >>> multiple_test_cases(-100)
    'large negative'
    """
    if number == 0:
        return "zero"
    elif number > 0:
        if number > 10:
            return "large positive"
        else:
            return "positive"
    else:
        if number < -10:
            return "large negative"
        else:
            return "negative"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
```
