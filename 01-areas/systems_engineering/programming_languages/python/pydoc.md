# `pydoc`

This module automatically generates documentation from Python modules. The documentation can be presented as pages of text on the console, served to a web browser or saved to HTML files.

```bash
python -m pydoc [OPTIONS]... ARGUMENT
```

> `ARGUMENT` can be the name of a function, module or package, or a dotted reference to a class, method or function within a module or module in a package.

- `-w`: writes HTML documentation to a file in the current directory, instead of displaying text on the console.

- `-k`: searches the synopsis lines of all available modules for the keyword given as the argument.

    > The synopsis line of a module is the first line of its documentation string.

- `-n <hostname>`: starts the server listening at the given hostname.

    > By default, the hostname is "localhost".

- `-b`: starts the server and opens a web browser to a module index page.

For modules, classes, functions and methods, the displayed documentation is derived from the docstring of the object and recursively from its documentable members.
