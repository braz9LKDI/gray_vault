# Package management

The most important determinant of distribution quality is the packaging system and the vitality of the distribution's support community...

## Packaging systems

...Most distributions fall into one of two camps of packaging technologies: the Debian `.deb` camp and the Red Hat `.rpm` camp...

## How a package system works

...Virtually all software for a Linux system will be found on the Internet. Most of it will be provided by the distribution vendor in the form of package files, and the rest will be available in source code form that can be installed manually.

### Package files

A package file is a compressed collection of files that comprise the software package. A package may consist of numerous programs and data files that support the programs...

### Dependencies

Programs are seldom "stand alone"; rather, they rely on the presence of other software components to get their work done. Modern package management systems all provide some method of dependency resolution to ensure that when a package is installed, all of its dependencies are installed, too.

### High- and low-level package tools

- Low-level tools: handle tasks such as installing and removing package files.

- High-level tools: perform metadata searching and dependency resolution.

## Common package management tasks

In the discussion that follows, the term `package_name` refers to the actual name of a package rather than the term `package_file`, which is the name of the file that contains the package.

- Finding a package in a repository.

- Installing a package from a repository.

- Installing a package from a package file.

- Removing a package.

- Updating packages from a repository.

- Upgrading a package from a package file.

- Listing installed packages.

- Determining whether a package is installed.

- Displaying information about an installed package.

- Finding which package installed a file.

### Distribution-independent package formats

Over the last several years distribution vendors have come out with universal package formats that are not tied to a particular Linux distribution. These include Snaps (developed and promoted by Canonical), Flatpaks (pioneered by Red Hat, but now widely available) and AppImages. Though they each work a little differently, their goal is to have an application and all of its dependencies bundled together and installed in a single piece.

There are some benefits to this packaging approach:

- Reducing the effort needed to distribute an application.

- Some of these formats also run the application in a containerized sandbox to provide additional security.

But there are some serious downsides too.

- Large size.

- Distribution integration.
