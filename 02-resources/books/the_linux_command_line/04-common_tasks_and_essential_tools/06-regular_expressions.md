# Regular expressions

## `grep`

The name "grep" is actually derived from the phrase "global regular expression print"...`grep` searches text files for the occurrence of text matching a specified regular expression and outputs any line containing a match to standard output.

```text
grep [OPTIONS] REGEX [FILE...]
```

| option | long option             | description                                                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i`   | `--ignore-case`         | ignore case.                                                                       |
| `-v`   | `--invert-match`        | print the lines that do not match.                                                 |
| `-c`   | `--count`               | print the number of matches instead of the lines.                                  |
| `-l`   | `--files-with-matches`  | print the name of each file that contains a match instead of the lines themselves. |
| `-L`   | `--files-without-match` | like `-l`, but print only the names of files that do not contain matches.          |
| `-n`   | `--line-number`         | prefix each matching line with the number of the line within the file.             |
| `-h`   | `--no-filename`         | for multi-file searches, suppress the output of filenames.                         |
| `-q`   | `--quiet`, `--silent`   | suppress all output.                                                               |

## Metacharacters and literals

...Regular expression metacharacters consist of the following:

- `^`.

- `$`.

- `.`.

- `[` and `]`.

- `{` and `}`.

- `-`.

- `?`.

- `*`.

- `+`.

- `(` and `)`.

- `|`.

- `\`.

All other characters are considered literals, though the backslash character is used in a few cases to create meta sequences, as well as allowing the metacharacters to be escaped and treated as literals instead of being interpreted as metacharacters.

> ...When we pass regular expressions containing metacharacters on the command line, it is vital that they be enclosed in quotes to prevent the shell from attempting to expand them.

## Anchors

The caret (`^`) and dollar sign (`$`) characters are treated as anchors in regular expressions. This means they cause the match to occur only if the regular expression is found at the beginning of the line (`^`) or at the end of the line (`$`).

## Bracket expressions and character classes

In addition to matching any character at a given position in our regular expression, we can also match a single character from a specified set of characters by using bracket expressions. With bracket expressions, we can specify a set of characters (including characters that would otherwise be interpreted as metacharacters) to be matched.

A set may contain any number of characters, and metacharacters lose their special meaning when placed within brackets. However, there are two cases in which metacharacters are used within bracket expressions and have different meanings. The first is the caret (`^`), which is used to indicate negation; the second is the dash (`-`), which is used to indicate a character range.

### Negation

The caret character only invokes negation if it is the first character within a bracket expression; otherwise, it loses its special meaning and becomes an ordinary character in the set.

### Traditional character ranges

To include a dash character in a bracket expression, it must be the first character of the expression.

### POSIX character classes

```bash
ls /usr/sbin/[ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]*
# /usr/sbin/MAKEFLOPPIES
# /usr/sbin/NetworkManagerDispatcher
# /usr/sbin/NetworkManager
ls /usr/sbin/[A-Z]*
# /usr/sbin/biosdecode
# /usr/sbin/chat
# /usr/sbin/chgpasswd
# /usr/sbin/chpasswd
# /usr/sbin/chroot
# /usr/sbin/cleanup-info
# /usr/sbin/complain
# /usr/sbin/console-kit-daemon
```

Back when Unix was first developed, it knew only about ASCII characters:

- 0-31 are control codes (things such as tabs, backspace and carriage returns).

- 32-63 contain printable characters, including most punctuation characters and the numerals 0-9.

- 64-95 contain the uppercase letters and a few more punctuation symbols.

Based on this arrangement, systems using ASCII used a collation order that looks like this:

```text
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

This differs from proper dictionary order, which is like this:

```text
aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJkKlLmMnNoOpPqQrRsStTuUvVwWxXyYzZ
```

As the popularity of Unix spread beyond the United States, there grew a need to support characters not found in U.S. English. The ASCII table was expanded to use a full eight bits, adding characters 128-255, which accommodated many more languages. To support this ability, the POSIX standards introduced a concept called a locale, which could be adjusted to select the character set needed for a particular location.

```bash
echo $LANG
# en_US.UTF-8
```

With this setting, POSIX-compliant applications will use a dictionary collation order rather than ASCII order.

To partially work around this problem, the POSIX standard includes a number of character classes that provide useful ranges of characters.

| character class | description                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `[:alnum:]`   | alphanumeric characters. In ASCII, equivalent to `[A-Za-z0-9]`.                                                                            |
|   `[:word:]`    | the same as `[:alnum:]`, with the addition of the underscore (`_`) character.                                                              |
|   `[:alpha:]`   | the alphabetic characters. In ASCII, equivalent to `[A-Za-z]`.                                                                             |
|   `[:blank:]`   | includes the space and tab characters.                                                                                                     |
|   `[:cntrl:]`   | ASCII control codes. Includes the ASCII characters 0 through 31 and 127.                                                                   |
|   `[:digit:]`   | the numerals 0 through 9.                                                                                                                  |
|   `[:graph:]`   | visible characters. In ASCII, it includes character 33 through 126.                                                                        |
|   `[:lower:]`   | lowercase letters.                                                                                                                         |
|   `[:punct:]`   | punctuation characters.                                                                                                                    |
|   `[:print:]`   | printable characters. All the characters in `[:graph:]` plus the space character.                                                          |
|   `[:space:]`   | whitespace characters including space, tab, carriage return, newline, vertical tab and form feed. In ASCII, equivalent to `[ \t\r\n\v\f]`. |
|   `[:upper:]`   | uppercase characters.                                                                                                                      |
|  `[:xdigit:]`   | characters used to express hexadecimal numbers. In ASCII, equivalent to `[0-9A-Fa-f]`.                                                     |

Even with the character classes, there is still no convenient way to express partial ranges.

#### Reverting to traditional collation order

To change the locale to use the traditional Unix behaviors, set `LANG` variable to `POSIX`.

```bash
export LANG=POSIX
```

> This change converts the system to use U.S. English (more specifically, ASCII) for its character set.

## POSIX basic vs. extended regular expressions

POSIX splits regular expression implementations into two kinds: basic regular expressions (BRE) and extended regular expressions (ERE).

With BRE, the following metacharacters are recognized:

- `^`.

- `$`.

- `.`.

- `[` and `]`.

- `*`.

All other characters are considered literals. With ERE, the following metacharacters are added:

- `(` and `)`.

- `{` and `}`.

- `?`.

- `+`.

- `|`.

However, the `(`, `)`, `{` and `}` characters are treated as metacharacters in BRE if they are escaped with a backslash, whereas with ERE, preceding any metacharacter with a backslash causes it to be treated as a literal.

...the GNU version of `grep` also supports extended regular expressions when `-E` is used.

## Alternation

It is the facility that allows a match to occur from among a set of expressions.

```bash
grep -Eh '^(bz|gz|zip)' dirlist*.txt # Match the filenames in our lists that start with either bz, gz, or zip
grep -Eh '^bz|gz|zip' dirlist*.txt # Match any filename that begins with bz or contains gz or contains zip
```

## Quantifiers

### `?`: match an element zero or one time

This quantifier means, in effect, "Make the preceding element optional".

### `*`: match an element zero or more times

Like the `?` metacharacter, the `*` is used to denote an optional item; however, unlike the `?`, the item may occur any number of times, not just once.

### `+`: match an element one or more times

The `+` metacharacter works much like the `*`, except it requires at least one instance of the preceding element to cause a match.

```bash
echo "This that" | grep -E '^([[:alpha:]]+ ?)+$'
# This that
echo "a b c" | grep -E '^([[:alpha:]]+ ?)+$'
# "a b c"
echo "a b 9" | grep -E '^([[:alpha:]]+ ?)+$'
#
echo "abc  d" | grep -E '^([[:alpha:]]+ ?)+$'
#
```

### `{`: and `}`: match an element a specific number of times

The `{` and `}` metacharacters are used to express minimum and maximum numbers of required matches.

|  specifier  | meaning                                                                                 |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `{<n>}`   | match the preceding element if it occurs exactly _n_ times.                             |
| `{<n>,<m>}` | match the preceding element if it occurs at least _n_ times but no more than _m_ times. |
|  `{<n>,}`   | match the preceding element if it occurs _n_ or more times.                             |
|  `{,<m>}`   | match the preceding element if it occurs no more than _m_ times.                        |

```text
^\(?[0-9][0-9][0-9]\)?  [0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$
^\(?[0-9]{3}\)?  [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$
```

## Putting regular expressions to work

### Validating a phone list with `grep`

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do echo "(${RANDOM:0:3}) ${RANDOM:0:3}-${RANDOM:0:4}" >> phonelist.txt; done

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #

grep -Ev '^\([0-9]{3}\) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$'
```

### Finding ugly filenames with `find`

Whereas `grep` will print a line when the line contains a string that matches an expression, `find` requires that the pathname exactly match the regular expression.

```bash
find . -regex '.*[^-_./0-9a-zA-Z].*'
```

### Searching for files with `locate`

`locate` supports both basic (the `--regexp` option) and extended (the `--regex` option) regular expressions.

### Searching for text with `less` and `vim`

`less` and `vim` both share the same method of searching for text. Pressing `/` followed by a regular expression will perform a search.

`less` supports extended regular expressions, but `vim` does not.

```text
^\([0-9]{3}\) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$
/([0-9]\{3\}) [0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}
```
