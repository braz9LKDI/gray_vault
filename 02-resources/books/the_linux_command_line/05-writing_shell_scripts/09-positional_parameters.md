# Positional parameters

## Accessing the command line

The shell provides a set of variables called positional parameters that contain the individual words on the command line. The variables are named `0` through `9`.

Even when no arguments are provided, `0` will always contain the pathname of the program being executed.

> Actually, more than nine can be accessed by enclosing the number in braces (`${<number>}`).

### Determining the number of arguments

The shell also provides a variable, `#`, that contains the number of arguments on the command line.

### `shift`: getting access to many arguments

The shell provides a method, albeit a clumsy one, to process many command arguments. `shift` causes all the parameters to "move down one" each time it is executed.

### Simple applications

`basename` removes the leading portion of a pathname.

### Using positional parameters with shell functions

Just as positional parameters are used to pass arguments to shell scripts, they can also be used to pass arguments to shell functions.

The `FUNCNAME` variable keeps track of the currently executed shell function.

## Handling positional parameters en masse

It is sometimes useful to manage all the positional parameters as a group. For example, we might want to write a "wrapper" around another program. This means we create a script or shell function that simplifies the invocation of another program...

The shell provides two special parameters for this purpose.

### `$*`

It expands into the list of positional parameters, starting with 1. When surrounded by double quotes, it expands into a double-quoted string containing all of the positional parameters, each separated by the first character of the `IFS` shell variable (by default a space character).

### `$@`

It expands into the list of positional parameters, starting with 1. When surrounded by double quotes, it expands each positional parameter into a separate word as if it was surrounded by double quotes.

```text
<script> <arg-1> <arg-2> ... <arg-n>
$* = <arg-1> <arg-2> ... <arg-n>
"$*" = "<arg-1> <arg-2> ... <arg-n>"
$@ = <arg-1> <arg-2> ... <arg-n>
"$@" = "<arg-1>" "<arg-2>" ... "<arg-n>"
```

`"$@"` is by far the most useful for most situations because it preserves the integrity of each positional parameter.

## A more complete application

### The `getopts` option

`getopts` is a shell built-in for parsing command-line options within scripts. It is designed to be called repeatedly in a while loop, processing one option per iteration until all options are consumed.

```text
getopts OPT_STRING VAR [ARG...]
```

_opt_string_ is a string that defines the valid option characters:

- A colon following a character signifies that the option requires an argument.

- A colon at the very beginning of the string enables "silent mode," giving control over error handling.

- Options can be grouped.

_var_ is the name of a variable that will hold the parsed option character on each iteration of the loop.

`OPTARG` is a special variable that holds the value of an option's argument.

`OPTIND` is an index variable, automatically managed by `getopts`, that points to the next positional parameter to be processed.

By default, `getopts` processes the script's positional parameters (`$@`), but a custom list of arguments can be supplied after _var_.

The while loop continues as long as `getopts` successfully finds an option. When an error occurs in silent mode:

- If an invalid option is found, var is set to `?` and `OPTARG` holds the invalid option character.

    > `?` must be escaped because the shell interprets it as a file wildcard character otherwise.

- If an option is missing a required argument, var is set to `:` and `OPTARG` holds the option that is missing its argument.
