# Flow control: looping with `while`/`until`

## Looping

### `while`

The syntax of `while` is as follows:

```bash
while commands; do commands; done
```

Like `if`, `while` evaluates the exit status of a list of commands. As long as the exit status is zero, it performs the commands inside the loop.

### `break`: and `continue`

`bash` provides two built-in commands that can be used to control program flow inside loops. `break` immediately terminates the loop, and program control resumes with the next statement following the loop. `continue` causes the remainder of the loop to be skipped, and program control resumes with the next iteration of the loop.

### `select`

The `select` shell built-in is used to create looping menus. It has a syntax that looks like this:

```text
select VAR in [STRING.. ;] do COMMANDS; done
```

where _var_ is a variable and _string_ is the text of a menu choice.

When `select` executes, it displays the string(s) followed by the content of `PS3` (prompt string 3) variable as a prompt for the user's input. Once a choice is made, it sets the `REPLY` variable with the user's input and returns the string associated with the choice in the variable _var_. Once the values are set, commands are performed and the prompt is displayed again for another choice.

`select` will continue indefinitely until either a `break` is encountered or the user types `CTRL + d` to signal end-of-file.

`select` does not display its menu choices or prompt string on standard output; rather, it uses standard error.

```bash
#!/bin/bash


DELAY=3
PS3="
Enter selection [1-4] > "

select str in \
    "Display system information" \
    "Display disk space" \
    "Display home space utilization" \
    "Quit"; do
    if [[ "$reply" == "1" ]]; then
        echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
        uptime
    elif [[ "$reply" == "2" ]]; then
        df -h
    elif [[ "$reply" == "3" ]]; then
        if [[ $(id -u) -eq 0 ]]; then
            echo "Home space utilization (all users)"
            du -sh /home/* 2> /dev/null
        else
            echo "Home space utilization ($USER)"
            du -sh "$HOME" 2> /dev/null
        fi
    elif [[ "$reply" == "4" ]]; then
        break
    fi
    else
        echo "Error: invalid entry" >&2
    sleep "$DELAY"
done
```

### `until`

It is much like `while`, except instead of exiting a loop when a non-zero exit status is encountered, it does the opposite. `until` continues until it receives a zero exit status.

## Reading files with loops

`while` and `until` can process standard input. This allows files to be processed with them.

```bash
loop read -r [var...]; do
    commands
done < text_file

<command> | loop read -r [var...]; do
    commands
done
```
