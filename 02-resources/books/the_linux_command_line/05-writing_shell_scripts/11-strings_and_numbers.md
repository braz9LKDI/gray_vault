# Strings and numbers

## Parameter expansion

### Expansions to manage empty variables

Several parameter expansions are intended to deal with nonexistent and empty variables. These expansions are handy for handling missing positional parameters and assigning default values to parameters.

```bash
${parameter:-word}
```

If _parameter_ is unset or is empty, this expansion results in the value of _word_. If _parameter_ is not empty, the expansion results in the value of _parameter_.

```bash
${parameter:=word}
```

If _parameter_ is unset or is empty, this expansion results in the value of _word_. In addition the value of _word_ is assigned to _parameter_. If _parameter_ is not empty, the expansion results in the value of _parameter_.

```bash
${parameter:?word}
```

If _parameter_ is unset or is empty, this expansion causes the script to exit with an error, and the contents of _word_ are sent to standard error. If _parameter_ is not empty, the expansion results in the value of _parameter_.

```bash
${parameter:+word}
```

If _parameter_ is unset or is empty, this expansion results in nothing. If _parameter_ is not empty, the value of _word_ is substituted for _parameter_; however, the value of _parameter_ is not changed.

### Expansions that return variable names

```bash
${!prefix*}
${!prefix@}
```

This expansion returns the names of existing variables with names beginning with _prefix_. According to the `bash` documentation, both forms of this expansion perform identically.

### String operations

```bash
${#parameter}
```

It expands into the length of the string contained by _parameter_. Normally, _parameter_ is a string; however, if _parameter_ is either `@` or `*`, then the expansion results in the number of positional parameters.

```bash
${parameter:offset}
${parameter:offset:length}
```

These expansions are used to extract a portion of the string contained in _parameter_. The extraction begins at _offset_ characters from the beginning of the string and continues until the end of the string, unless _length_ is specified.

If the value of _offset_ is negative, it is taken to mean it starts from the end of the string rather than the beginning. Note that negative values must be preceded by a space to prevent confusion with the `${<parameter>:-<word>}` expansion. _length_, if present, must not be less than zero.

If _parameter_ is `@`, the result of the expansion is _length_ positional parameters, starting at _offset_.

```bash
${parameter#pattern}
${parameter##pattern}
```

These expansions remove a leading portion of the string contained in _parameter_ defined by _pattern_. _pattern_ is a wildcard pattern like those used in [[02-resources/books/the_linux_command_line/02-learning_the_shell/07-seeing_the_world_as_the_shell_sees_it#Pathname expansion|pathname expansion]]. The difference in the two forms is that the `#` form removes the shortest match, while the `##` form removes the longest match.

```bash
${parameter%pattern}
${parameter%%pattern}
```

These expansions are the same as the previous `#` and `##` expansions, except they remove text from the end of the string contained in _parameter_ rather than from the beginning.

```bash
${parameter/pattern/string}
${parameter//pattern/string}
${parameter/#pattern/string}
${parameter/%pattern/string}
```

This expansion performs a search-and-replace operation upon the contents of _parameter_. If text is found matching wildcard _pattern_, it is replaced with the contents of _string_. In the normal form, only the first occurrence of _pattern_ is replaced. In the `//` form, all occurrences are replaced. The `/#` form requires that the match occur at the beginning of the string, and the `/%` form requires the match to occur at the end of the string. In every form, `/<string>` may be omitted, causing the text matched by _pattern_ to be deleted.

### Case conversion

`bash` has four parameter expansions and two declare command options to support the uppercase/lowercase conversion of strings.

- `declare -u <var>`: for uppercase.

- `declare -l <var>`: for lowercase.

In addition to `declare`, there are four parameter expansions that perform upper/lower-case conversion.

|            format            | result                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${<parameter>,,<?pattern>}` | expand the value of _parameter_ into all lowercase. _pattern_ is an optional shell pattern that will limit which characters are converted. |
| `${<parameter>,<?pattern>}`  | expand the value of _parameter_, changing only the first character to lowercase.                                                           |
| `${<parameter>^^<?pattern>}` | expand the value of _parameter_ into all uppercase letters.                                                                                |
| `${<parameter>^<?pattern>}`  | expand the value of _parameter_, changing only the first character to uppercase.                                                           |

## Arithmetic evaluation and expansion

### Number bases

In arithmetic expressions, the shell supports integer constants in any base.

|     notation      | description                 |
| :---------------: | :-------------------------- |
|    `<number>`     | decimal.                    |
|    `0<number>`    | octal.                      |
|   `0x<number>`    | hexadecimal.                |
| `<base>#<number>` | _number_ is in base _base_. |

### Unary operators

There are two unary operators, `+` and `-`, which are used to indicate whether a number is positive or negative, respectively.

### Simple arithmetic

| operation |   description    |
| :-------: | :--------------: |
|    `+`    |     addition     |
|    `-`    |   subtraction    |
|    `/`    | integer division |
|   `**`    |  exponentiation  |
|    `%`    |      modulo      |

### Assignment

|         notation         |       description       |
| :----------------------: | :---------------------: |
| `<parameter> = <value>`  |    simple assignment    |
| `<parameter> += <value>` |        addition         |
| `<parameter> -= <value>` |       subtraction       |
| `<parameter> *= <value>` |     multiplication      |
| `<parameter> /= <value>` |    integer division     |
| `<parameter> %= <value>` |         modulo          |
|     `<parameter>++`      | variable post-increment |
|     `<parameter>--`      | variable post-decrement |
|     `++<parameter>`      | variable pre-increment  |
|     `--<parameter>`      | variable pre-decrement  |

### Bit operations

| operator |     description     |
| :------: | :-----------------: |
|   `~`    |  bitwise negation   |
|   `<<`   | left bitwise shift  |
|   `>>`   | right bitwise shift |
|   `&`    |     bitwise AND     |
|    \|    |     bitwise OR      |
|   `^`    |     bitwise XOR     |

Note that there are also corresponding assignment operators for all but bitwise negation.

### Logic

`(( ))` supports the following logic operators:

|           operator           |       description        |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------------: |
|             `<=`             |  less than or equal to   |
|             `>=`             | greater than or equal to |
|             `<`              |        less than         |
|             `>`              |       greater than       |
|             `==`             |         equal to         |
|             `!=`             |       not equal to       |
|             `&&`             |       logical AND        |
|             \|\|             |        logical OR        |
| `<expr-1>?<expr-2>:<expr-3>` |     ternary operator     |

Performing assignment within the expressions of the ternary operator is not straightforward: those expressions must be surrounded by parentheses.

## `bc`: an arbitrary precision calculator language

If more complex mathematical calculations are required, `bash` cannot handle them, so it is necessary to use an external program. That program can be `bc`.

`bc` reads a file written in its own C-like language and executes it. A `bc` script may be a separate file, or it may be read from standard input. `bc` language supports quite a few features including variables, loops and programmer-defined functions.

### Using `bc`

The copyright message can be suppressed with `-q`.

The ability to take standard input means that we can use here documents, here strings and pipes to pass scripts.
