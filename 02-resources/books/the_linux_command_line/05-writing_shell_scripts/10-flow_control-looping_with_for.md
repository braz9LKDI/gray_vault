# Flow control: looping with `for`

## `for`: traditional shell form

```bash
for var [in words]; do
    commands
done
```

where _var_ is the name of a variable that will increment during the execution of the loop, _words_ is an optional list of items that will be sequentially assigned to _var_, and _commands_ are the commands that are to be executed on each iteration of the loop.

The really powerful feature of `for` is the number of interesting ways we can create a list of words.

Pathname expansion provides a nice, clean list of pathnames that can be processed in the loop. The one precaution needed is to check that the expansion actually matched something. By default, if the expansion fails to match any files, the wildcards themselves will be returned. To guard against this, the `[[ -e "$i" ]]` command can be used.

If the optional `in <words>` portion of `for` is omitted, `for` defaults to processing the positional parameters.

### Why i?

The basis of this tradition comes from the Fortran programming language. In Fortran, undeclared variables starting with the letters `I`, `J`, `K`, `L` and `M` are automatically typed as integers, while variables beginning with any other letter are typed as reals. This behavior led programmers to use the variables `I`, `J` and `K` for loop variables since it was less work to use them when a temporary variable was needed.

It also led to the following Fortran-based witticism:

"GOD is real, unless declared integer".

## `for`: C language form

```bash
for (( expression_1; expression_2; expression_3 )); do
    commands
done
```

Here _expression_1_, _expression_2_ and _expression_3_ are arithmetic expressions and _commands_ are the commands to be performed during each iteration of the loop.

In terms of behavior, this form is equivalent to the following construct:

```bash
(( expression_1 ))
while (( expression_2 )); do
    commands
    (( expression_3 ))
done
```

_expression_1_ is used to initialize conditions for the loop, _expression_2_ is used to determine when the loop is finished and _expression_3_ is carried out at the end of each iteration of the loop.

## Summing up

```bash
report_home_space() {
    local format="%8s%10s%10s\n"
    local dir_list total_files total_dirs total_size user_name

    if [[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]]; then
        dir_list=/home/*
        user_name="all users"
    else
        dir_list="$HOME"
        user_name="$USER"
    fi

    echo "<h2>Home space utilization ($user_name)</h2>"

    for i in $dir_list; do
        total_files="$(find "$i" -type f | wc -l)"
        total_dirs="$(find "$i" -type d | wc -l)"
        total_size="$(du -sh | cut -f 1)"

        echo "<h3>$1</h3>"
        echo "<pre>"
        printf "$format" "dirs" "files" "size"
        printf "$format" "----" "-----" "---"
        printf "$format" "$total_dirs" "$total_files" "$total_size"
        echo "</pre>"
    done
    return
}
```
