# Flow control: branching with `case`

## `case`

In `bash`, the multiple-choice compound command is `case`. It has the following syntax:

```bash
case word in
    [pattern] [| pattern]...) commands;;]...
esac
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash


clear
echo "
Please select:
0. Quit.
1. Display system information.
2. Display disk space.
3. Display home space utilization.
"
read -r -p "Enter selection [0-3] > "

case "$REPLY" in
    0)
        echo "Exiting..."
        exit
        ;;
    1)
        echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
        uptime;;
    2)
        df -h
        ;;
    3)
        if [[ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]]; then
            echo "Home space utilization (all users)"
            du -sh /home/*
        else
            echo "Home space utilization ($USER)"
            du -sh $HOME
        fi
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Error: invalid option" >&2
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
```

### Patterns

The patterns used by `case` are the same as those used by [[02-resources/books/the_linux_command_line/02-learning_the_shell/07-seeing_the_world_as_the_shell_sees_it#Pathname expansion|pathname expansion]], so [[02-resources/books/the_linux_command_line/02-learning_the_shell/04-manipulating_files_and_directories#Wildcards|wildcards]] are allowed. Patterns are terminated with `)`.

It is also possible to combine multiple patterns using `|` as a separator. This creates an "or" conditional pattern. This is useful for such things as handling both uppercase and lowercase characters.

### Performing multiple actions

Modern versions of `bash` add `;;&` notation to terminate each action and allow `case` to continue to the next test rather than simply terminating.
