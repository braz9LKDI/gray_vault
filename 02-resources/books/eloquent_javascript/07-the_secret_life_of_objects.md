# The secret life of objects

> "An abstract data type is realized by writing a special kind of program \[...\] which defines the type in terms of the operations which can be performed on it." (Barbara Liskov, Programming with Abstract Data Types)

## Abstract data types

Each abstract data type has an interface, the collection of operations that external code can perform on it. Any details beyond that interface are encapsulated, treated as internal to the type and of no concern to the rest of the program.

## Methods

In JavaScript, methods are nothing more than properties that hold function values.

```javascript
function speak(line) {
    console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says "${line}"`);
}
let white_rabbit = { type: "white", speak };
let hungry_rabbit = { type: "hungry", speak };

white_rabbit.speak("Oh my fur and whiskers"); // The white rabbit says "Oh my fur and whiskers"
hungry_rabbit.speak("Got any carrots?"); // The hungry rabbit says "Got any carrots?"
```

Since each function has its own `this` whose value depends on the way it is called, the `this` of the wrapping scope cannot be referred to in a regular function defined with the function keyword.

Arrow functions are different: they do not bind their own `this` but can see the `this` binding of the scope around them. Thus, something like the following code is possible, which references `this` from inside a local function:

```javascript
let finder = {
    find(array) {
        return array.some((v) => v == this.value);
    },
    value: 5,
};
console.log(finder.find([4, 5])); // true
```

## Prototypes

Objects can be linked to other objects, to magically get all the properties that other object has. Plain old objects created with `{ }` notation are linked to an object called `Object.prototype`.

When an object gets a request for a property that it does not have, its prototype will be searched for the property. If that does not have it, the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until an object without prototype is reached (`Object.prototype`).

`Object.create` can be used to create an object with a specific prototype:

```javascript
let rabbit_prototype = {
    speak(line) {
        console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says "${line}"`);
    },
};
let black_rabbit = Object.create(rabbit_prototype);
black_rabbit.type = "black";
black_rabbit.speak("I am fear and darkness"); // The black rabbit says "I am fear and darkness"
```

## Classes

JavaScript's prototype system can be interpreted as a somewhat free-form take on abstract data types or classes. A class defines the shape of a type of object, what methods and properties it has. Such an object is called an instance of the class.

JavaScript's class notation makes it easier to define this type of function, along with a prototype object.

```javascript
class Rabbit {
    constructor(type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
    speak(line) {
        console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says "${line}"`);
    }
}
```

The `class` starts a class declaration, which allows us to define a constructor and a set of methods together. Any number of methods may be written inside the declaration's braces.

This function cannot be called like a normal function. Constructors, in JavaScript, are called by putting `new` in front of them. Doing so creates a fresh instance object whose prototype is the object from the function's prototype property, then runs the function with `this` bound to the new object and finally returns the object.

Like `function`, `class` can be used both in statements and in expressions. When used as an expression, it does not define a binding but just produces the constructor as a value. The class name can be omitted in a class expression.

```javascript
let object = new (class {
    get_word() {
        return "hello";
    }
})();
console.log(object.get_word()); // hello
```

## Private properties

To declare a private method, put a `#` in front of its name. Such methods can be called only from inside the class declaration that defines them.

To use private instance properties, they must be declared. Regular properties can be created by just assigning to them, but private properties must be declared in the class declaration to be available at all.

## Overriding derived properties

When a property is added to an object, whether it is present in the prototype or not, the property is added to the object itself. If there was already a property with the same name in the prototype, this property will no longer affect the object, as it is now hidden behind the object's own property.

## Maps

A map (noun) is a data structure that associates values (the keys) with other values.

For this reason, using plain objects as maps is dangerous. There are several possible ways to avoid this problem. First, objects with no prototype can be created. If `null` is passed to `Object.create`, the resulting object will not derive from `Object.prototype` and can be safely used as a map.

> The danger is reading keys inherited from the prototype, which were never declared on the object itself.

```javascript
console.log("toString" in Object.create(null)); // false
```

Object property names must be strings. If a map is needed whose keys cannot easily be converted to strings (such as objects), an object cannot be used as the map.

Fortunately, JavaScript comes with a class called `Map` that is written for this exact purpose. It stores a mapping and allows any type of keys.

```javascript
let ages = new Map();
ages.set("Boris", 39);
ages.set("Liang", 22);
ages.set("Júlia", 62);

console.log(`Júlia is ${ages.get("Júlia")}`); // Júlia is 62
console.log("Is Jack's age known?", ages.has("Jack")); // Is Jack's age known? false
console.log(ages.has("toString")); // false
```

If a plain object must be treated as a map for some reason, it is useful to know that `Object.keys` returns only an object's own keys, not those in the prototype. As an alternative to the `in` operator, `Object.hasOwn` can be used, which ignores the object's prototype.

```javascript
console.log(Object.hasOwn({ x: 1 }, "x")); // true
console.log(Object.hasOwn({ x: 1 }, "toString")); // false
```

## Polymorphism

...Polymorphic code can work with values of different shapes, as long as they support the interface it expects.

## Symbols

...Symbols are values created with the Symbol function. Unlike strings, newly created symbols are unique...

```javascript
let symbol = Symbol("name");
console.log(symbol == Symbol("name")); // false
```

The string you pass to Symbol is included when you convert it to a string and can make it easier to recognize a symbol...

Being both unique and usable as property names makes symbols suitable for defining interfaces that can peacefully live alongside other properties, no matter what their names are.

```javascript
const length = Symbol("length");
Array.prototype[length] = 0;

console.log([1, 2].length); // 2
console.log([1, 2][length]); // 0
```

It is possible to include symbol properties in object expressions and classes by using square brackets around the property name. That causes the expression between the brackets to be evaluated to produce the property name...

```javascript
let my_trip = {
    length: 2,
    0: "Lankwitz",
    1: "Babelsberg",
    [length]: 21500,
};
console.log(my_trip[length], my_trip.length); // 21500 2
```

## The iterator interface

The object given to a for/of loop is expected to be iterable. This means it has a method named with the `Symbol.iterator` symbol...

When called, that method should return an object that provides a second interface, iterator. This is the actual thing that iterates. It has a `next` method that returns the next result. That result should be an object with a `value` property that provides the next value, if there is one, and a `done` property, which should be `true` when there are no more results and `false` otherwise.

## Inheritance

Whereas encapsulation and polymorphism can be used to separate pieces of code from one another, reducing the tangledness of the overall program, inheritance fundamentally ties classes together, creating more tangle. When inheriting from a class, more usually has to be known about how it works than when simply using it. Inheritance can be a useful tool to make some types of programs more succinct, but it should not be the first tool reached for, and opportunities to construct class hierarchies (family trees of classes) should probably not be actively sought.
