# Inheritance in JavaScript

## Classes

```javascript
const me = {
    talk() {
        return "Talking";
    },
};

me.talk();

const you = {
    talk() {
        return "Talking";
    },
};

you.talk();
```

The problem with this approach is that it lends itself to repetitive and unmaintainable code.

> Imagine that you have to update the function definition, you must modify all the objects.

## `prototype` And `__proto__`

```javascript
class Person {
    talk() {
        return "Talking";
    }
}

const me = new Person();
me.talk();

const you = new Person();
you.talk();

Person.prototype.talk = function () {
    return "New and improved Talking";
};
```

Now, with this approach, we can modify the function definition in all objects by modifying the prototype.

> Class syntax is just another way of referring to prototype inheritance (**syntatic sugar**).

## Objects and prototypal inheritance

What JavaScript is doing under is this:

```javascript
function Person() {}

Person.prototype.talk = function () {
    return "Talking";
};
```

## Properties vs methods

Assigning `talk` as a property to the constructor would be this:

```javascript
function Person() {
    this.talk = function () {
        return "Talking";
    };
}
```

The problem with this is that every time we create a person the `talk` is being copied, which leads to the same problem as the first approach.

## Extending Classes

```javascript
class Person {
    talk() {
        return "talking";
    }
}

class SuperHuman extends Person {
    fly() {
        return "flying";
    }
}

const me = new Person();
console.log(me.talk);
console.log(me.fly);

const you = new SuperHuman();
console.log(you.fly);
console.log(you.talk);
```

## 3 Ways to create an inheritance chain

### Inheritance using pure objects with `Object.create`

```javascript
const person = {
    talk() {
        return "Talking";
    },
};

const me = Object.create(person);
me.talk();
```

### Inheritance using pure objects with `Object.setPrototypeOf`

```javascript
const person = {};

person.__proto__.talk = function () {
    return "Talking";
};
const me = {};
Object.setPrototypeOf(me, person);
me.talk();
```
