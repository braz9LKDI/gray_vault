# Temario

## Comandos básicos de Linux

- `id [OPTION]... [USER]...`: print user and group information for each specified USER, or (when USER omitted) for the current process.

- `grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]`: grep searches for `PATTERNS` in each FILE. `PATTERNS` is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.

- `/etc/group`: defines the groups in the system. There is one entry per line, with the following format:

    ```bash
      group_name:password:GID:user_list
    ```

    The fields are as follows:
    - `group_name`: the name of the group.

    - `password`: the (encrypted) group password. If this field is empty, no password is needed.

    - `GID`: the numeric group ID.

    - `user_list`: a list of the usernames that are members of this group, separated by commas.

    > These days, many people run some version of the shadow password suite, where `/etc/passwd` has an `x` in the password field, and the encrypted passwords are in `/etc/shadow`, which is readable by the superuser only.

- `/etc/passwd`: describes user login accounts for the system. Each line of the file describes a single user, and contains seven colon-separated fields:

    ```bash
      name:password:UID:GID:GECOS:directory:shell
    ```

    The fields are as follows:
    - `name`: the user's login name. It should not contain capital letters.

    - `GID`: the numeric primary group ID for this user.

        > Additional groups for the user are defined in the system group file (`/etc/group`).

    - `GECOS` (General Electric Comprehensive Operating System): is optional and used only for informational purposes.

        > Usually, it contains the full username.

    - `directory`: the user's home directory (the initial directory where the user is placed after logging in).

        > This field is used to set the `HOME` environment variable.

    - `shell`: program to run at login (if empty, use `/bin/sh`).

        > If set to a nonexistent executable, the user will be unable to log in through `login`.
        >
        > The value in this field is used to set the `SHELL` environment variable.

- `/etc/shells`: is a text file that contains the full pathnames of valid login shells.

## Control del flujo stderr-stdout, operadores y procesos en segundo plano

- `/etc/hosts`: is a simple text file that associates IP addresses with hostnames, one line per IP address. For each host, a single line should be present with the following information:

    ```bash
      IP_address canonical_hostname [aliases...]
    ```

- `command; ...; command`: is used to separate multiple commands on the same line.

- `command && ... && command`: execute the command that follows it only if the previous command completes successfully.

- `command || ... || command`: execute the command that follows it only if the previous command fails.

- `/dev/null`: data written to this file is discarded.

    > It is used as a data sink.

### Environment variables

Often referred to as ENVs, they are dynamic values that influence the behavior of programs and processes in the Linux operating system.

- `$?`: is used to store the exit status of the last command executed in a shell script or a terminal. The exit status is a number between 0 and 255 that indicates whether the command was completed successfully or failed.

    > A value of 0 means success, while any other value means failure.

### Bash redirections

They are a way of manipulating the input and output of commands in a shell script or a terminal. By default, a command takes input from the keyboard and outputs it to the screen, but redirections allow changing the source and destination of the data.

- `cmd > file`: redirects the standard output (stdout) of `cmd` to `file`.

- `cmd &> file`: redirects stdout and stderr of `cmd` to `file`.

- `cmd > file 2>&1`: another way to redirect both stdout and stderr of `cmd` to `file`.

    > `> file` redirects stdout to `file`, and `2>&1` redirects stderr to the same place where stdout is going, which is `file` in this case.

- `cmd &`: run a command in the background.

- `disown`: is used to remove jobs from the job table or keep them running even after the terminal window is closed.

## Descriptores de archivo

They are used to represent open files, sockets, pipes and other input and output streams. A file descriptor is a non-negative integer value that serves as a unique identifier for a file or input/output channel that a process has opened.

- `exec [command [argument...]]`: shall open, close and/or copy file descriptors as specified by any redirections as part of the command.

    > If `exec` is specified with command, it shall replace the shell with command without creating a new process. If arguments are specified, they shall be arguments to the command.

    Examples:
    - `exec 3<> file`: open `file` as file descriptor `3` for reading and writing.

        > To write to this file, we can use `... >&3`.

    - `exec 4[<>]&3`: make file descriptor `4` a copy of file descriptor `3`.

    - `exec 3[<>]&-`: close file descriptor `3`.

    - `exec 4[<>]&3-`: make file descriptor `4` a copy of file descriptor `3` and close file descriptor `3`.

## Lectura e interpretación de permisos

By executing `ls -l`, we can list the files using a long list format, which will show us the security of the files or directories. An example of this is:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 Brandon Brandon 4096 Jan 27 15:01 temp
```

Separating it into columns:

1. First.
    1. First character.
        - `-`: means it is a file.

        - `d`: means it is a directory.

    2. The next nine characters.
        - (`xxxxxxxxx`): show the security.

2. Second: number of hard links to the file or directory.

3. Third: owner of the file.

4. Fourth: group owner of the file.

5. Fifth: size of the file in bytes.

6. Sixth: the date and time the file was last modified.

7. Seventh: name of the file or the directory.

### What are the three permission groups in Linux?

```text
---     ---     ---
rwx     rwx     rwx
user    group   other
```

### What are the three kinds of file permissions in Linux?

- `r` (read).

- `w` (write).

- `x` (execute).

    > In directories, it allows the user to enter the directory, and access files and directories inside.

### Operators and options

- `+`: add permissions.

- `-`: remove permissions.

- `=`: set the permissions to the specified values.

---

- `u` (user): applies only to the owner of the file or directory.

- `g` (group): applies only to the group that has been assigned to the file or directory.

- `o` (other): applies to all other users on the system.

- `a` (all): all three (owner, groups, others).

## Asignación de permisos

To change the security permissions on files, we use `chmod`, which stands for "change mode", because the nine security characters are collectively called the security mode of the file.

- `chmod [OPTION]...`: change file mode bits.
    - `MODE[,MODE]... FILE...`.

    - `OCTAL-MODE FILE...`.

    - `--reference=RFILE FILE...`.

- `chgrp [OPTION]...`: change group ownership.
    - `GROUP FILE...`.

    - `--reference=RFILE FILE...`.

- `chown [OPTION]...`: change file owner and group.
    - `[OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...`.

    - `--reference=RFILE FILE...`.

- `useradd`: create a new user or update the default new user information.
    - `[options] LOGIN`.

    - `-D`.

    - `-D [options]`.

- `groupadd [OPTIONS] NEWGROUP`: create a new group.

- `usermod [options] LOGIN`: modify a user account.

---

- `chmod ug+rw,o-x file.txt`: adds read (`r`) and write (`w`) permission to both user (`u`) and group (`g`) and revokes execute (`x`) permission from others (`o`) for the file `file.txt`.

- `chgrp new_group file.txt`: change the `file.txt` group to the `new_group` group.

- `useradd -m test`: create a user called "test" (with its respective group) and create its home directory.

## Notación octal de permisos

| octal | binary | file mode |
| :---: | :----: | :-------: |
|   0   |  000   |   `---`   |
|   1   |  001   |   `--x`   |
|   2   |  010   |   `-w-`   |
|   3   |  011   |   `-wx`   |
|   4   |  100   |   `r--`   |
|   5   |  101   |   `r-x`   |
|   6   |  110   |   `rw-`   |
|   7   |  111   |   `rwx`   |

The octal notation table can be used instead of `r`, `w` and `x`. Each octal digit sets the permissions of one group: `u`, `g` or `o`. Executing `chmod ugo+rwx file.txt` is equal to `chmod 777 file.txt`.

## Permisos especiales y atributos de ficheros: sticky bit, `chattr`, `lsattr`, SUID y SGID

### The setuid bit

This bit is present for files that have executable permissions. The setuid bit simply indicates that when running the executable, it will set its permissions to those of the user who created it (the owner), instead of setting them to the user who launched it. Similarly, there is a setgid bit that does the same for the gid.

To locate the setuid, look for an `s` instead of an `x` in the executable bit of the file permissions in the owner permission group.

- Set the setuid bit: `chmod u+s <file>` or `chmod 4--- <file>`.

- Remove the setuid bit: `chmod u-s <file>` or `chmod --- <file>`.

### The setgid bit

This bit affects both files and directories. When used on a file, it executes with the privileges of the group of the user who owns it, instead of executing with those of the group of the user who executed it. When the bit is set for a directory, the set of files in that directory will have the same group as the group of the parent directory, and not that of the user who created those files.

- Set the setgid bit: `chmod g+s <file>` or `chmod 2--- <file>`.

- Remove the setgid bit: `chmod g-s <file>` or `chmod --- <file>`.

### The sticky bit

When a directory has the sticky bit set, its files can be deleted or renamed only by the file owner, the directory owner and the root user.

- Set the sticky bit: `chmod +t <file>` or `chmod 1--- <file>`.

- Remove the sticky bit: `chmod -t <file>` or `chmod --- <file>`.

## Capabilities (privilegios especiales)

For the purpose of performing permission checks, traditional UNIX implementations distinguish two categories of processes: privileged processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser or root), and unprivileged processes (whose effective UID is nonzero). Starting with Linux 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with the superuser into distinct units, known as capabilities, which can be independently enabled and disabled.

---

There are 5 options for a capability:

1. Permitted.

2. Inheritable.

3. Effective.

4. Bounding.

5. Ambient.

Only the first three can be assigned to executable files.

---

There are a lot of capabilities, but the most interesting two are:

- `CAP_SETUID`: make arbitrary manipulations of process UIDs.

- `CAP_SETGID`: make arbitrary manipulations of process GIDs.

---

- `getcap [-v] [-n] [-r] [-h] filename [...]`: displays the name and capabilities of each specified file.

- `setcap [-q] [-n <rootuid>] [-v] {capabilities|-|-r} filename [... capabilitiesN fileN]`: in the absence of the `-v` (verify) option, setcap sets the capabilities of each specified filename to the capabilities specified.

Examples of usage:

- `getcap -r / 2> /dev/null`: search for files that have capabilities in the entire system.

- `setcap -r file`: remove all the capabilities assigned to `file`.

- `setcap "all+pe cap_chown-pe" file`: add all capabilities in the Permitted and Effective sets of an executable, except for the `CAP_CHOWN` capability.

## Estructura de directorios del sistema

In Linux/Unix operating system, everything is a file; even directories are files, files are files and devices like mouse, keyboard, printer, etc. are also files.

### Types of files in the Linux system

- General files.

- Directory files.

- Device files.

![Linux directory structure](02-resources/courses/assets/courses/introduccion_a_linux/01_01-linux_directory_structure.png)

The Linux/Unix file system hierarchy base begins at the root, and everything starts with the root directory.

## Búsquedas a nivel de sistema

- `find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]`: search for files in a directory hierarchy.

    Some interesting options are:
    - `-type c`: file is of type "c".
        - `f`: regular file.

        - `d`: directory.

    - `-name pattern`: base of filename (the path with the leading directories removed) matches shell pattern "pattern".

        > `-iname pattern` like `-name`, but the match is case insensitive.

    - `-perm mode`: file's permission bits are exactly "mode".

    - `-group gname`: file belongs to group "gname".

        > A numeric group ID is allowed.

    - `-user uname`: file is owned by user "uname".

        > A numeric user ID is allowed.

    - `-ls`: list current file in `ls -dils` format on standard output.

    - `! expr`: true if "expr" is false.

        > This character will also usually need protection from interpretation by the shell.
        >
        > `-not expr` same as `! expr`, but not POSIX compliant.

- `xargs [options] [command [initial-arguments]]`: build and execute command lines from standard input.

    Because Unix filenames can contain blanks and newlines, this default behavior is often problematic; filenames containing blanks and/or newlines are incorrectly processed by xargs. In these situations, it is better to use the `-0` option, which prevents such problems. When using this option, the program which produces the input for xargs must also use a null character as a separator.

    > If that program is GNU find for example, the `-print0` option does this.

Examples of usage:

- `find / -name passwd 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l`: list every file named `passwd` in the system.

## Conexiones SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used for transferring encrypted data over a network. An SSH key is the access credential this protocol uses for authentication.

It always comes in a key pair:

1. Public key: everyone can see it; there is no need to protect it.

    > For encryption function.

2. Private key: stays on the computer; must be protected.

    > For decryption function.

### How does SSH work?

It uses asymmetric ciphers for encryption and decryption. The general procedure is:

1. Public keys from the local computers (system) are passed to the server, which is to be accessed.

2. The server then determines if the public key is registered.

3. If so, the server then creates a new secret key and encrypts it with the public key that was sent to it via a local computer.

4. This encrypted code is sent to the local computer.

5. This data is unlocked by the private key of the system and sent to the server.

6. The server, after receiving this data, verifies the local computer.

7. SSH creates a route, and all the encrypted data is transferred through it with no security issues.

SSH is key-based authentication that is not prone to brute-force attacks.

    exit 1
}

trap ctrl_c INT

file=$1

while [ $file ]; do
    7z x $file &>/dev/null
    echo -e "Decompressed file: $file\n"
    file="$(7z l $file 2>/dev/null | tail -n 3 | head -n 1 | awk 'NF{print $NF}')"

## Abusando de tareas cron

### Cron

It is a widely used software utility available on Unix-like operating systems that is used for the purpose of job scheduling. Certain programs or scripts that might be required to be run occasionally are added as a Cron job and a schedule is defined to describe when to run this job.

#### Expressions (Cron)

They provide one way of specifying a schedule.

```text
seconds minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week year
```

Based on the values specified for each of the components above, complex schedules may be created. Special characters used in cron expressions:

| character |                                                                                                             meaning                                                                                                              |
| :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    `*`    |                                            All. Represents that the schedule should run for every time unit. A `*` in the minute field indicates that the schedule runs every minute.                                            |
|    `?`    | Any. Represents any arbitrary value. This can be used only in `day-of-month` and `day-of-week` fields. A `?` in `day-of-month` field will not use the `day-of-month` for deciding the schedule, as any value is acceptable here. |
|    `-`    |                                                                                         Range. Represents a continuous range of values.                                                                                          |
|    `,`    |                                                                                      Multiple values. Separates a list of different values.                                                                                      |
|    `/`    |                                                                           Increment. Specifies the amount by which to increment the values of a field.                                                                           |

> The `day-of-month` and `day-of-week` fields cannot be specified with the same value simultaneously in the same cron expression. If one of the two values is represented by a `*` the other must be represented by `?`.
